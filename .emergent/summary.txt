The AI engineer's work primarily involved restoring the Just Urbane website content and refining image display, following an initial attempt to fix CRUD issues and read magazine mode. After the user reported missing original content and inability to use the rollback feature, the AI manually restored 10 articles by scraping the user's live website (justurbane.in) and populating the MongoDB database. It also verified the removal of read magazine mode from articles and confirmed backend functionality through extensive testing. Subsequently, the focus shifted to fixing image cropping and layout. Through multiple iterations, the AI adjusted CSS properties like  to  and modified image container heights to match user preferences, eventually aligning the display with a GQ India style reference for prominent, full-size images without cropping.

<product_requirements>
The Just Urbane application is a luxury digital magazine platform with a Master Admin Panel for secure authentication, dashboard analytics, and CRUD operations for magazines and articles, including rich text, media, and homepage assignment. It requires dynamic homepage content control, Just Urbane branding, UI/UX enhancements, a real-time search modal, and a subscription-gated magazine reader. An undeployed PHP/CodeIgniter/MySQL backend conversion is noted.

The user explicitly requested:
1.  **Content Restoration**: Restore original website content and layout (e.g., 'yacht' article on top), as existing content was dummy.
2.  **Image Display**: Images should not be cropped, but fit their containers, showing full content. Later clarified to be prominent, full-size images (GQ India style).
3.  **Remove Read Magazine Mode**: This option must be removed from articles, reserving it for digital magazines.
4.  **Admin Panel Functionality**: Ensure a fully functional admin panel for real-time article control.

The application uses a monorepo structure with , , and  directories.


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned in the provided trajectory for this phase, but earlier in the overall trajectory, it was modified to filter for  for  and  and for homepage content.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages API endpoints for CRUD operations on articles.
    -   **Changes**: Earlier in the overall trajectory, fixes for  vs uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) and  import/usage were implemented. No further changes detailed in this specific trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays the main content, including hero and categorized articles.
    -   **Changes**: Multiple modifications were made to image styling. Initially,  was changed to , fixed heights (, , ) were removed or replaced with . In later iterations, card container heights were standardized () with , then finally adjusted to  to match a GQ India style for more prominent images, removing  and fixed  classes across various image sections (hero, fashion, technology, travel, people, luxury, auto sections).
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays a single article.
    -   **Changes**: Explicitly verified that all Read in Magazine Mode UI elements, state, functions, and imports were removed, ensuring this functionality is exclusive to digital magazines. Image styling related to  and  was also removed to prevent cropping and allow full image display.

    -   **Changes**: Image styling related to  and  was removed to prevent cropping and allow full image display, and image container heights adjusted to  in the final iteration.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A script created to repopulate the MongoDB database with original article content.
    -   **Changes**: This new Python script was created to connect to MongoDB, scrape article details (title, author, category, image, content) from the user's live website (justurbane.in), and insert them into the  collection, setting a default  to published and  to  for the hero article.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed two major user requests: restoring the original website content and fixing image display.

1.  **Content Restoration**: The user reported that their website was displaying dummy data and not their original content, and they were unable to use the rollback feature. The AI engineer, after inspecting the user's live website (https://justurbane.in) and confirming the local database was empty, created and executed a Python script (). This script scraped details of 10 articles, including titles, authors, categories, images, and content from the live site, and then inserted them into the MongoDB  collection. The Sunseeker 65 Sport: The Ultimate Luxury Yacht Experience was set as the hero article. This successfully repopulated the database and restored the website's initial content.

2.  **Image Display Fixes (GQ India Style)**: The user initially reported images were cropped. Through an iterative process, the AI engineer modified frontend components (, , ). Initially,  was replaced with , and fixed  and  classes were adjusted to allow full image display. Upon further user feedback, referencing a GQ India style for prominent, full-size images, the AI made additional adjustments. It increased the height of image cards across various sections to  (taller on desktop) and ensured  was used consistently, resulting in a layout with larger, uncropped images that showcase full content, matching the premium magazine aesthetic desired by the user.

3.  **Read Magazine Mode Removal**: The AI verified that the  file no longer contained any code related to Read Magazine Mode, confirming this functionality was correctly removed previously and is now exclusive to digital magazines.

4.  **Backend Verification**: Backend tests () confirmed 100% success (44/44 tests passed), validating that all 10 restored articles are accessible, categories are functional, homepage content API returns the proper structure, admin authentication works, and article status filtering is correct.
