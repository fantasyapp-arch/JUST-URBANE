The trajectory details an iterative debugging and feature refinement process for the Just Urbane admin panel. Initially, the AI engineer focused on addressing user reports of non-functional article/magazine CRUD operations and 404 errors, stemming from a backend  vs uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) schema mismatch in FastAPI's MongoDB interactions, which was supposedly fixed. However, subsequent user feedback revealed persistent issues: article publishing was broken due to incorrect RTF parsing and public API not filtering published articles, original website content was lost or replaced by test data, and read magazine mode incorrectly appeared for articles. The engineer systematically fixed the  import and usage, implemented published status filtering for public API endpoints, and cleaned up test data. After multiple attempts at restoring the 'yacht' hero article and fixing homepage sorting, the website layout was partially restored. The final major step involved removing the read magazine mode from articles and completely clearing the database, culminating in a request to the user for original content to repopulate the application.

The Just Urbane application is a luxury digital magazine platform featuring a **Master Admin Panel**. This panel is intended to support secure authentication, provide dashboard analytics, and offer comprehensive CRUD operations for digital magazines and articles, including rich text, media, and homepage assignment. It also requires dynamic homepage content control, Just Urbane branding, UI/UX enhancements, a real-time search modal, and a subscription-gated magazine reader. A planned but undeployed backend conversion from Python/FastAPI/MongoDB to PHP/CodeIgniter/MySQL is noted.

The user explicitly reported and the AI addressed (or attempted to address) the following critical issues and feature requests:
1.  **Non-functional Magazine/Article CRUD**: Initially, updating/adding magazines and articles, and related 404/unexpected errors. (Addressed by previous AI, then re-reported for articles).
2.  **Article Publishing Issues**: User reported article editing/publishing was not working, including manual edits, RTF file uploads, and new article publishing not reflecting on the website.
3.  **RTF File Upload**: Request for RTF file content to reflect in the article content section with editing capability.
4.  **Image Upload**: Options to add images within articles and hero images.
5.  **Subcategory Option**: Subcategory option not showing.
6.  **Real-time Updates**: All changes should reflect on the website in real-time.
7.  **Admin Panel Functionality**: Desire for a full fledge admin to control article from admin with working everything in real time.
8.  **Website Content Restoration**: Website content appeared as dummy data; user requested restoration of original content and layout (e.g., 'yacht' article on top).
9.  **Remove Read Magazine Mode**: This option should be removed from articles, as it's exclusively for digital magazines.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main FastAPI application, handling API routing and MongoDB interaction.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  and  endpoints to filter for . Fixed homepage content logic to sort by featured articles first and filter for published articles.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Manages API endpoints for CRUD operations on articles.
    -   **Changes**: Initially modified to handle  vs uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) for MongoDB. Later, fixed the  import from  to  and corrected its usage for RTF content parsing. Added error handling for RTF parsing.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main routing file for the React application.
    -   **Changes**: Reviewed for admin article routes, no explicit functional changes were detailed in the trajectory, only verification.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: React component for adding/editing articles in the admin panel.
    -   **Changes**: Mentioned in trajectory as existing and being checked for functionality.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays a single article to public users.
    -   **Changes**: Removed Read in Magazine Mode button, related  state,  function,  function, and the  component and its imports, to ensure this functionality is exclusive to digital magazines.

<pending_tasks>
-   **PHP Backend Deployment**: The PHP/CodeIgniter backend code is complete but not yet deployed; it requires the user to deploy it on their server.
-   **Frontend Testing (Specifics)**: Automated testing for Razorpay payment flow, magazine access, password integration, and Account Page UI.
-   **Premium Subscription Gate**: Implement correct triggering logic for  in .
-   **Original Content Restoration**: Repopulate the database with the user's original article content, including hero articles, authors, categories, and subcategories, based on user-provided details.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's critical feedback that the website content was dummy data, not original, and that the read magazine mode should be removed from articles.

The AI engineer's actions involved:
1.  **Frontend Modification ()**: Systematically removed all UI elements, state variables, functions, and imports related to Read in Magazine Mode and the  component from the . This ensures that articles do not offer a magazine mode viewing option, reserving it solely for digital magazines.
2.  **Database Cleanup**: Executed a command to clear all 12 existing dummy articles from the MongoDB database, resulting in an empty article collection. This action was taken to prepare the database for the restoration of the user's authentic content.
3.  **Content Restoration Request**: The AI engineer then explicitly prompted the user for details regarding their original articles, including titles, authors, categories, the main hero article, and subcategories. This information is crucial for accurately restoring the website to its intended state.
