The Just Urbane application aims to be a premium digital magazine, akin to , built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It features a premium UI, brand logo integration, and Stripe-managed subscription models (Digital, Print, Print+Digital). User authentication includes Google Gmail and smart account creation on purchase. All PDF content must be categorized.

The initial request in this trajectory was to implement a flip book magazine reading experience for subscribed customers, allowing them to browse content like a physical magazine, adhering to premium, smooth, easy to use design principles. Following this, the user explicitly requested that the main Digital Magazine page () should display actual magazine covers, professional layouts, and a superior user experience, moving away from unnecessary things and basic article listings, referencing GQ's magazine page for style. This included showing a free preview of 2-3 pages before locking content for subscribers with a clear buy prompt.
