The previous AI engineer successfully integrated a France Travel article into the Just Urbane magazine app. This involved RTF content parsing, adding initial and additional images to MongoDB via custom Python scripts (, ), creating a dedicated React page (), and updating routing (, ). Testing confirmed full backend and frontend functionality.

Subsequently, the user requested modifications to the footer in . The specific tasks were: 1) remove Privacy Information from the mobile view, and 2) make the More from Just Urbane section expandable on mobile. I addressed these by implementing React  for the toggle, using  for chevron icons, applying existing  CSS for smooth transitions, and using Tailwind's  to hide the privacy section responsively. Comprehensive testing via screenshots and clicks verified that both mobile and desktop views functioned as expected. All tasks are completed, and  has been updated.

<product_requirements>
The Just Urbane application is a luxurious digital magazine, similar to . The initial product requirements focused on integrating articles like Celini Food Review and Scottish Leader whiskey with specific luxury designs, responsiveness, and precise categorization (, ). A key objective was to standardize the system for efficient future content additions.

The immediate past request was to integrate a new France Travel article, categorized under , including an RTF document and multiple images. This integration had to conform to the existing luxury article template for both backend data structure and frontend presentation. A follow-up request involved adding *additional* topic-specific images to this integrated article, ensuring proper display, correct routing, and overall design consistency.

The most recent explicit request from the user was to modify the application's footer:
1.  Remove the Privacy Information section specifically from the mobile view.
2.  Make the More from Just Urbane section in the footer interactive and expandable, similar to a dropdown menu, allowing categories to be displayed upon clicking an arrow.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully completed the full integration of the France Travel article. This involved creating  to seed initial data and images into MongoDB (/ category/subcategory), developing  for the frontend display, and updating  and  for routing. Later,  was used to add supplementary images to the article in the database, with  updated to display these. Backend and frontend tests confirmed the article's full functionality and aesthetic.

Following this, the explicit user request was to modify the footer (). The work involved:
1.  **Removing privacy information from the mobile view**: The relevant section in  was wrapped in a div with Tailwind's  class, effectively hiding it on screens smaller than a medium breakpoint.
2.  **Making More from Just Urbane expandable**: This involved adding React  to manage the  state. A click handler was implemented to toggle this state. The section's visibility and the chevron icon (imported from  as  or ) now dynamically change based on . An existing  CSS class from  was applied for a smooth visual effect.

The implementation was thoroughly tested. Screenshots confirmed the privacy section's absence on mobile and proper display on desktop. Click tests verified the expand/collapse functionality of More from Just Urbane on mobile, showing category links and service links, and the correct arrow icon change. Desktop view functionality remained unaffected, preserving existing layouts. The  file was updated to document these successful footer modifications.
