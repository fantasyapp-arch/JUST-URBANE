    message: "üéØ HOMEPAGE WHITE SPACE ELIMINATION - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED. After systematic investigation, the persistent white spaces were caused by systematic Tailwind CSS padding classes throughout all homepage sections. Every major section used `py-6` (24px top/bottom padding = 48px total per section), creating 288px+ of cumulative white space across 6+ sections. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: ‚úÖ Replaced all `py-6` with `py-1` in section elements ‚úÖ Reduced `mb-6` to `mb-3` in headers/containers ‚úÖ Reduced `px-4` to `px-2` for horizontal spacing ‚úÖ Changed `bg-gray-100` to `bg-white` to eliminate visual contrast ‚úÖ Reduced excessive `pt-6`, `pt-8`, `pb-4` classes throughout. RESULT: Complete elimination of white spaces, achieving the dense, content-rich GQ India-style layout requested by user. Homepage now has minimal spacing with maximum content density."
