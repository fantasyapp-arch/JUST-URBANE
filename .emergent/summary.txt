The trajectory details the evolution of the Just Urbane digital magazine application. Initially, the previous AI engineer focused on integrating a Sustainable Travel article, which involved backend scripting (, ) to manage MongoDB content and frontend development (, , ) for display and routing. A critical bug regarding subcategory validation was resolved during this phase. Subsequently, the user requested a significant redesign of the Digital Magazine (IssuesPage.js), citing alignment, content relevance, and aesthetic issues. The AI engineer iteratively addressed these concerns, applying multiple rounds of styling and content adjustments based on direct user feedback and screenshots, culminating in a premium, aligned, and professional-looking page with a single featured magazine thumbnail, which was then successfully tested.
