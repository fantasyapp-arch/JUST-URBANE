This trajectory chronicles the transformation of the Just Urbane application through a series of iterative development and bug-fixing cycles. Initially, the focus was on integrating Razorpay, a critical payment gateway, while meticulously removing the older Stripe implementation. This involved backend API adjustments for order creation and verification, along with frontend UI updates and the introduction of a customer details modal. A significant Pay Now bug, caused by strict authentication requirements, was resolved by allowing optional guest checkout for Razorpay endpoints. Subsequently, the AI engineer addressed multiple UI/UX issues on the , including design reversions, fixing a missing icon, implementing a focused highlight effect, and resolving color muting in a key section, alongside enhancing hover effects.
A core user requirement for complete digital magazine access post-payment drove the implementation of a subscription-based access control system, tied to a new user authentication flow. This involved adjusting user models and payment verification to grant premium status. A bug preventing immediate magazine access after purchase was traced to  not refreshing user data, which was fixed by introducing a dedicated method to update user state. The system was further enhanced by adding a password creation option during subscription, integrating it securely into the backend and frontend. Finally, a major bug on the My Account page, involving fake data and poor UI alignment, was entirely resolved by refactoring the page to display real user and subscription data dynamically from the backend, coupled with significant UI refinements for professional presentation. Each phase was followed by rigorous testing and user confirmations, showcasing a comprehensive approach to feature development and bug resolution.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported bug concerning the My Account page (). The user explicitly stated that all alignments and all things are not aligned calculated peopler texts are touching to reader border and all datas are fake so connect it to real data and show only real data of users and realtime data of users everything.

Upon investigation, the AI engineer confirmed the root causes:
1.  The  was using entirely hardcoded, fake data (lines 16-65) instead of real user information.
2.  The UI suffered from poor alignment, spacing, and padding, leading to an unprofessional layout.
3.  There was no integration with the actual user data available from the  or a backend API.

To resolve these issues, the AI engineer undertook a complete rewrite of . The key modifications included:
*   **Data Integration**: The page was refactored to dynamically fetch and display real user data (such as name, email, member since date) and subscription details (current plan, status, expiry date, features) from the  and the backend's  endpoint. This ensured that all information presented was live and accurate.
*   **UI/UX Refinement**: Comprehensive styling adjustments were made using Tailwind CSS, focusing on  and other calculated margins/paddings to achieve professional alignment, spacing, and a modern, responsive design, eliminating text touching borders.
*   **Dynamic Plan Details**: The page now correctly displays dynamic plan details (e.g., Digital ₹1, Print ₹499, Combined ₹999) based on the user's actual subscription.
*   **State Management**: Proper UI states for loading, logged-out users (displaying an improved login prompt), and error handling were also implemented.

The work was successfully verified through screenshots showing a well-aligned login prompt when not logged in, and backend testing confirmed that the  endpoint now provides comprehensive and accurate real user data, perfectly aligning with the frontend's needs. The My Account page bug is now completely resolved, offering a professional display of real user data.
