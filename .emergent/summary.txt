The trajectory details the evolution of the Just Urbane application, initiated by a previous AI engineer and continued by the current one. The initial phase focused on UI enhancements, specifically redesigning  to match premium article layouts and iteratively refining  branding. The subsequent major task was integrating the Razorpay payment gateway. After receiving live Razorpay credentials, the engineer configured the backend and frontend, replacing an existing Stripe integration. A critical bug emerged where the Pay Now button failed to redirect to Razorpay. This was diagnosed as an authentication issue for order creation, leading to backend modifications in  to allow optional authentication (guest checkout) for Razorpay order and verification endpoints. The payment flow, including dynamic customer address collection for print subscriptions, was successfully fixed and verified through extensive backend testing and frontend screenshots.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in fixing a critical bug in the Razorpay payment flow. The user reported that clicking Pay Now was not redirecting to Razorpay.

The investigation revealed that the backend Razorpay order creation endpoint () was requiring authentication, which prevented guest users from initiating payments. To resolve this, the AI engineer modified  to make the authentication for both  and  endpoints optional, allowing guest checkout.

After this backend fix, a comprehensive testing process was executed:
1.  **Backend API Testing**: Confirmed that Razorpay order creation worked successfully without prior user authentication, returning a valid Razorpay order ID.
2.  **Frontend Payment Flow Testing (via screenshots)**:
    *   Verified that filling customer details and clicking Pay Now now correctly opened the Razorpay payment modal, displaying the amount and various payment options.
    *   Confirmed that for print subscriptions, the dynamic address collection fields (Address Line 1, City, State, Postal Code, Country) appeared and were marked as required, demonstrating smart address validation.

All backend tests passed with a 100% success rate, confirming the complete resolution of the Pay Now bug and the full functionality of the Razorpay payment flow with customer details and conditional address collection.
