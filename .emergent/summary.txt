The AI engineer processed the RTF content and image, created backend scripts for database insertion, generated a new React page component, and updated frontend routing in  and . While backend integration was confirmed successful, the frontend article page initially showed  errors, then a Loading article... state, which the AI engineer deemed successful without explicit content rendering verification.
