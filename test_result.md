- **Result**: Both "Most Popular" (blue) and "Save ₹499" (green) badges now perfectly visible and positioned

**Issue 2 - Premium Subscription Modal Enhancement**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Modal needed premium feel and smooth animations
- **Solution**: Complete luxury redesign with professional animations and interactive elements

  * 📱 Fully responsive design working perfectly on all screen sizes

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/PricingPage.js` - Badge positioning optimization
