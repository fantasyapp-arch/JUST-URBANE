Console logs confirm proper category/subcategory routing. ✅ MOBILE COMPATIBILITY: All dropdown functionality works perfectly on mobile viewport with proper touch interactions. ⚠️ Minor Issue: Click outside menu to close functionality had one test failure but overall menu closing works via subcategory clicks and navigation.

CONCLUSION: While the Oscars Fashion article exists with excellent content quality and all 4 new images are accessible externally, the main requirement of integrating these 4 additional images into the article to achieve 9 total images has NOT been completed. The article needs to be updated to include the 4 new images in its gallery array or body content."

CONCLUSION: While the Oscars Fashion article exists with excellent content quality and all 4 new images are accessible externally, the main requirement of integrating these 4 additional images into the article to achieve 9 total images has NOT been completed. The article needs to be updated to include the 4 new images in its gallery array or body content."
