The trajectory details a complex iterative development process. Initially, the previous AI engineer focused on UI enhancements and integrated Razorpay, replacing Stripe. The current AI engineer inherited this with a critical Pay Now bug, which was fixed by allowing optional authentication for Razorpay backend endpoints. Subsequently, the user requested design reversions for the  (first to a simpler theme, then back to the original premium design). The final phase involved resolving specific UI bugs on the pricing page: a missing icon on the Print Subscription card, adding a highlight effect on page load, and fixing greyed-out colors in the Why Choose Just Urbane section caused by an overly broad highlight, alongside ensuring proper hover effects on the pricing cards. All issues were progressively addressed and verified with screenshots.

The Just Urbane application is a luxury digital magazine platform. Development aimed to improve content presentation, refine branding, and expand payment options.

**Completed tasks by previous AI engineer:**
*   **Men's Fashion Article Page Enhancement:** The Perfect Suit Guide for Men article () was refactored for a premium aesthetic, including breadcrumbs, a hero section, rich content, tags, back navigation, and new images.
*   **Footer Branding Updates:** The footer () copyright text was updated to © 2025 Just Urbane. All rights reserved. Designed and Developed by Satmat Group with Satmat Group hyperlinked.

**Tasks completed in this trajectory by current AI engineer:**
*   **Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration & Flow Refinement:** Integrate Razorpay for magazine purchases. This involved removing Stripe completely, changing payment options to Select Plan buttons, integrating a customer details form () with conditional address collection for print subscriptions, and embedding the Pay Now button, ensuring Razorpay redirection. A critical bug was fixed by allowing optional user authentication (guest checkout) for Razorpay order creation and verification.
*   **Pricing Page UI/UX Enhancements & Bug Fixes:**
    *   Reverted the  design to an earlier, simpler theme (design-only, functionality preserved).
    *   Undid the previous reversion, restoring the page to its original premium design.
    *   Fixed a missing icon on the Print Subscription plan.
    *   Implemented a page-load highlight effect on the pricing page.
    *   Resolved a bug where the highlight effect caused the Why Choose Just Urbane section to appear grey and ensured hover effects on pricing cards were functional.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively engaged in fixing two user-reported visual issues on the . The user reported that some colours are showing grey where why choose just urbane is and that a highlighted type should be happend when hovering over plans.

Upon investigation via a screenshot, it was identified that:
1.  A previously implemented full-page dark overlay was causing the Why Choose Just Urbane section's vibrant colors to appear muted or grey.
2.  The hover effects on the pricing cards were not functioning as intended.

To resolve these, the AI engineer made several modifications to :
*   The full-page overlay that was causing the grey colors was removed.
*   A more subtle and *focused* highlight area was implemented specifically around the pricing cards, including a gentle pulsing animation to draw attention.
*   The hover interactions for the pricing cards were significantly enhanced, incorporating multiple visual feedback layers such as scaling up (), an increased shadow (), a slight upward movement (), a blue ring highlight (), and a subtle background tint ().
*   Z-index issues were addressed to ensure proper layering, making sure that the Why Choose Just Urbane section was fully visible and displayed its intended vibrant colors without interference.

The work was concluded with multiple verification screenshots, confirming that all sections now display their intended vibrant colors and that the professional hover effects on the pricing cards are fully functional, providing clear visual feedback.
