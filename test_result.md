The article needs to be updated to include the 4 new images in its gallery array or body content."

After systematic investigation, the persistent white spaces were caused by systematic Tailwind CSS padding classes throughout all homepage sections.

CONCLUSION: While the Oscars Fashion article exists with excellent content quality and all 4 new images are accessible externally, the main requirement of integrating these 4 additional images into the article to achieve 9 total images has NOT been completed. The article needs to be updated to include the 4 new images in its gallery array or body content."
