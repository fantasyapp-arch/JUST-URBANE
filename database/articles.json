    "body": "\"Nowness in a little over a dozen dishes\". Somewhere I had read these words, describing a new restaurant entrant in some part of the world, for its menu. And I could co-relate it to this restaurant's menu when I skimmed through it.\n\nMenus can do it. Capture a moment in time. Celini, Mumbai's classic fine dining Italian relaunched in time when the economy resurrects and ups its pace. It's all very 2022! Smart, keenly priced, ingredient led, it's a menu that understands our palate before even serving it to us at the table.\n\nIt's an amalgamation of food and a crisp conceptual proposition. Helmed by Chef Gianfranco Tuttolani, hailing from the provincial capital of Chieti, flavours of the Abruzzi province is brought to the fore through his masterful culinary expertise. With accolades from the Italian Chef Federation, A.C.V.S. (Villa Santa Maria Chef Association) and ambassadorship across various fronts, his culinary prowess extended multifield when he represented Italian cuisine at the 5th Italian Cuisine in the World Forum in Greece.\n\nAs Chef Gianfranco takes on his next assignment as Head Chef of Grand Hyatt Mumbai's Italian Signature restaurant Celini, he states, \"It is a great pleasure to take up my new role as head Chef of Celini at Grand Hyatt Mumbai Hotel and Residences. It will be exciting to implement my skills and knowledge, and bring to the people of Mumbai, authentic and traditional flavours from my home country-Italy.\"\n\nAnd it's not just the food; it's also the befitting setting we are ambiently marked with. There's the pared-back art inspired d\u00e9cor, slate grey ceiling and white walls adorned by masterpieces of installations. And of course, the end to end open kitchen. Not to miss are its artefacts, one such being Yogadakshinamurti, an installation that symbolises the movements within our bodies, the sun and the constellations, thus personifying immeasurable celestial bodies!\n\nAll these also resonate with the Italian fare that conjured before our eyes at the table with a melange of flavours of the Millefeuille, Spaghetti Aglio Olio e Peperoncino, Mushroom Ravioli, Caprese and Prosciutto, Ossobuco, Seabass Livornese and Panna Cotta to name a few.\n\nIt's also the house for Celini's all-time favourite wood-fired pizzas, pastas and risotto, and that have been a key highlight of the restaurant since inception paired with an exhaustive list of distinctively refreshing Italian red and white wines.\n\nCelini feels like Mumbai's answer to the marvelous chef Franco's welcome note that is one which punches well above its weight. With it being a definite must-visit, we endorse it for its authenticity and all things Italian!",

    "dek": "Scottish Leader Original whiskey is a blend of malt and grain whiskies, which has been recently introduced in India. But, does it have all that to fare against the existing great whiskeys in the market?",
    "body": "2022 couldn't have started better for whiskey lovers in India! After 45 years of splendid history, Distell International and Aspri Spirits joined hands to introduce the Scottish Leader Original whiskey in India. Honestly, I have never fallen in the category of whiskey drinkers for an obvious reason \u2013 its taste. But, when the brand insisted on trying out its very first launch product, I thought to myself, why not give it a try?\n\nUnboxing the hamper, you find a bottle of whiskey in a red carton reminiscent of a famous brand, a pair of whiskey glasses, a peg measurer and a handy flask. The alcohol percentage in the whiskey is 42.8 percent volume per volume, and besides that, on the nose the Scottish Leader Original hints us of a malt, sherry or oak, with a soft smokiness behind.\n\nThe whiskey, when sipped with water and a few cubes of ice, tasted pleasant or rather sweet to me. You certainly get a taste of a whiskey with flavours of toffee and nuts, and bits of orange with caramel. The whiskey struck a perfect balance of spice and sweetness, smooth in every slurp with the rich taste, and had a long finish with a touch of mild oak.\n\nWith awards like 2019 Scotch Whiskey Masters Gold, 2019 World Whiskey Awards Silver, 2020 International Wine and Spirits Competition Silver and 2021 Scotch Whiskey Masters Silver, Scottish Leader Original is available across India in Punjab (Rs 1,500), Maharashtra (Rs 2,750), Karnataka (Rs 2,449) and Telangana (Rs 2,150).",

    "title": "When In France",
    "dek": "Summer in Paris! Sounds dreamy, right? Turns out that Eiffel Tower is not the only destination you can visit in the city of love. Keep reading to discover multiple tourist destinations in France.",
    "body": "Mesmerised by the beauty of the land, France is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. A country with fine wine, delicious food, and some of the most beautiful destinations on earth, there is only so much one can take in. From the world-class art and architecture, beautiful beaches, medieval urban centres to the dynamic cities, Renaissance ch\u00e2teaux, incredible gastronomy, expansive vineyards, spectacular landscapes, and the Pyrenees and The Alps, there are innumerable breath-taking scenes in L'Hexagone.\n\nThere is more than enough to keep interested travellers occupied, from rolling vineyards and tumbling valleys to towering sand dunes and magnificent villages. Choosing places to visit in France can be confusing because there is so much to see and do. You will definitely want to end up visiting every destination. So, to narrow down your options, here are our picks to add in your travel bucket list.\n\n**The Island Of Corsica**\n\nCorsica's spectacular coastal scenery, unspoiled woods, and snowy peaks all contribute to the island's rough and natural appeal. Beautiful beaches, calm bays, picturesque fishing towns, and busy seaside cities along the island's coastline, while the inland slopes are covered with old villages where time seems to have stopped.\n\nIt has a gorgeous yet wild appeal, with stylish seaside cities, steep granite peaks, and unspoiled forests. It is also a destination for snorkelling and scuba diving, with 1,000 kilometres of lovely blue shoreline to uncover. You might come across much free-roaming wildlife such as pigs, cows, and goats. But there is nothing to worry about as there are no harmful snakes to disrupt your vacation.\n\n**Paris and Versailles**\n\nIt is impossible to not visit Paris when in France. Paris is on top of the to-visit list among other destinations. A perfect kiss, the perfect picture before the Eiffel Tower is a dream. Paris is a major European centre known for its splendour and joie de vivre, with architectural wonders such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral.\n\nParis' evocative medieval neighbourhoods and beautiful boulevards are among the city's other attractions. The UNESCO-listed Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles is a short rail trip from Paris. This lavish 17th-century palace, built for Louis XIV (the \"Sun King\"), is a testimony to the French monarch's greatness and ultimate power.\n\n**The Land of Lavender: Provence**\n\nProvence enjoys beautiful Mediterranean sunshine for most part of the year. This rural location has a raw, earthy look, as though it has been unaffected by the modern world. It is one of the most beautiful and aromatic destinations to visit in France every summer, thanks to the nearly unending waves of lavender fields.\n\nSo basically, you get to visit, stand, or even run through fields that have a lavender scent. No wonder painters found inspiration for bright works of art in this dreamy environment. The monks of the abbey and the local honeybees tend to these lovely lavender fields. Visitors are welcome to stay with them for a peaceful spiritual retreat.\n\n**Mont Saint-Michel**\n\nThe Normandy region's centrepiece, Mont Saint-Michel, is a peaceful environment of apple orchards, forests, and cow pastures. This must-see tourist site is at the top of a long list of Normandy travel attractions that includes spectacular views like medieval castles and picturesque towns.\n\nThe tiny, curving alleyways and charming wooden cottages that lead up to it add to the romance. In fact, the breathtaking landscape inspired Rapunzel's Tower and the Kingdom of Corona in Disney's Tangled. In the 8th century, the magnificent island village functioned as a major Christian pilgrimage centre. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site that receives over three million visitors each year.\n\n**Loire Valley**\n\nThe Loire Valley, also known as the \"Garden of France,\" was formerly the refuge of French monarchy and nobility. Today, however, it is one of France's most iconic tourist destinations, available to all. The Loire Valley spans for 175 miles along the Loire River, winding its way past some of France's most attractive communities, including Amboise, where Leonardo da Vinci spent his final years.\n\nThe valley is also famous for its widely popular wines. In fact, several local winemakers invite tourists for a tour through their cellar and wine-tasting. Due to the obvious richness of flower gardens, fruit orchards, and vineyards, the Loire Valley is called the \"Garden of France\". The Cher, Loiret, Eure and Loire rivers replenish the valley, making it lush and fruitful.\n\n**Strasbourg**\n\nStrasbourg is the meeting point between France and Germany. Strasbourg, the capital city of the Alsace region, is located on the border between the two countries. It is home to the European Parliament as well as a slew of other important European institutions, including the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe.\n\nGrande Ile, the city's historic centre, is a must-see. The centre offers many museums and striking attractions, such as the stunning Gothic cathedral, which features pink sandstone, intricate carvings, and a 300-year-old working astrological clock.",

    "dek": "You have been there and done that how about doing it a different way this time? I am not talking about making a bucket list, I am talking about travelling with a consciousness. Travelling sustainably so that your future generations can see the places you love.",
    "body": "Over the last few years there has been tremendous growth in the tourism sector. Overtourism is a term that best describes this scenario in which one tourist destination is being visited by a large number of tourists. A popular example of this is how the love lock bridge in Paris had to be taken down due to the over weight of the locks being put up by tourists visiting the monument. Many such instances have made the public adapt a more conscious way of traveling.\n\nSustainable travel focuses on reducing the negative impact of traveling by cutting down carbon footprints. Introducing sustainability into travel can make a lot of difference in the conservation of our natural habitat. But do you think traveling while being sustainable can be possible? Well, the answer to it, doubles up as a question in itself. And the question is, are you ready to take a sustainable trip? If your answer is yes, then be ready because it is going to be a little more difficult than you think.\n\nPrince Harry, the Duke of Sussex recently launched an eco-travel campaign in New Zealand that was inspired by Maori Practices. Under his leadership, a non-profitable organisation, Travalyst that aims to promote sustainable travel. This website basically encourages travelers to choose sustainability for their upcoming travel journey. The first step when you visit the website will lead you to a questionnaire that asks you five steps about your plan. Also, if this isn't enough to boost your plan then regional tour operators are there to guide you for your trip.\n\nBreaking away from your regular routine can be enjoyable, but it's crucial to consider how your plans will impact the environment. Although by no means exhaustive, we have gathered five suggestions to help you plan a trip that has a lower impact on the environment. So here's a guide that will help you plan a trip taking the conservation of your planet earth into consideration.\n\n**Keep It Clean & Keep It Green**\n\nRemember your responsibility towards nature and become a responsible guest. Do not litter and damage the properties. Try your best to recycle, conserve electricity and water, and engage in activities that don't significantly harm the environment and help in preserving the flora and fauna of the place you're visiting.\n\n**Take A Sustainable Transport**\n\nThe next step comes to your plan is the method of transportation. How to get there is a crucial step to consider. Always try to opt for a bus or a train journey as they are responsible for less carbon emission. The invention of e-buses have contributed a lot into the preservation of our planet so you must go for an e-lift whenever you are traveling.\n\n**Where To Stay?**\n\nSearching for a sustainable stay is a task. Look for stays and hotels that recycle, have efficient waste management systems, and use renewable energy sources (solar, hydroelectric, etc). Extra points if the homestay boosts the local economy, especially if it's part of an eco-tour.\n\n**A Return Gift**\n\nWho doesn't love souvenirs? But buying something that is illegal or harmful such as animal hides, ivory or intoxicants isn't a great way of gifting. You wouldn't want to risk the biodiversity of the place by carrying anything that harms the environment in any way. Instead buy gifts that support the local economy such as traditional weaves, handicrafts and local delicacies.\n\n**Where Are You Going?**\n\nDeciding your destination is the most important step. A considerable point to keep in mind while selecting a destination is how far the place is and what mode of transportation you would require to reach there. To travel in a more environmentally friendly manner, consider participating in eco-tourism. These kinds of businesses provide vacations to locations all over the world, giving each one a high priority for sustainability.",

    "dek": "Master the art of corporate dressing with our comprehensive guide to perfect suit selection, fit, and styling for the modern professional man",
    "body": "The perfect suit is more than just clothing\u2014it's a statement of professionalism, confidence, and attention to detail. In today's competitive corporate environment, how you dress can significantly impact your career trajectory and professional relationships.\n\n**Understanding Suit Fundamentals**\n\nA well-fitted suit begins with understanding the three essential components: the jacket, trousers, and the harmony between them. The jacket should sit comfortably on your shoulders without pulling or bunching, while the trousers should complement your body type and maintain a clean, professional silhouette.\n\n**Fabric Selection for Corporate Excellence**\n\nChoose fabrics that reflect both quality and practicality. Wool remains the gold standard for business suits, offering durability, breathability, and a professional appearance that maintains its shape throughout long workdays. For year-round versatility, consider Super 120s wool or wool blends that provide comfort in various climates.\n\n**Color Psychology in Corporate Dressing**\n\nNavy blue and charcoal gray form the foundation of any professional wardrobe. These colors project authority, trustworthiness, and sophistication while remaining versatile enough to pair with various shirt and tie combinations. Black suits, while formal, are best reserved for evening events rather than daily corporate wear.\n\n**The Art of Proper Fit**\n\nA perfectly fitted suit should feel like a second skin\u2014comfortable yet structured. The jacket length should allow for a quarter to half-inch of shirt cuff to show, while the trouser break should create a slight crease at the shoe without excessive bunching.\n\n**Styling for Success**\n\nComplete your corporate look with quality accessories: a well-crafted leather belt that matches your shoes, a sophisticated watch, and a tie that complements rather than competes with your suit. Remember, the goal is to look polished and professional, allowing your expertise and personality to shine through your impeccable presentation.\n\n**Investment in Quality**\n\nA quality suit is an investment in your professional future. While the initial cost may be significant, a well-made suit will serve you for years, maintaining its appearance and fit with proper care and occasional tailoring adjustments.\n\n**Maintenance and Care**\n\nProper suit care extends its lifespan significantly. Rotate between multiple suits to allow fabrics to rest, use quality hangers to maintain shape, and establish relationships with skilled tailors and dry cleaners who understand the nuances of fine menswear.",

    "body": "The 94th Academy Awards showcased some of the most spectacular fashion moments in recent Oscar history. From stunning gowns to bold fashion statements, celebrities brought their A-game to Hollywood's biggest night. Here's our curated selection of the best dressed stars who commanded attention on the red carpet.\n\n**Blue Hues - Megan Thee Stallion**\n\nThe famed American rapper and \"Sweetest Pie\" singer Megan Thee Stallion walked the red carpet in a metallic blue strapless gown that was sculpted for her. The plunging neckline number hugged her hourglass figure and featured a single waist cut-out with an asymmetrical hem. The outfit bore a ruffled pattern from her hips that gave it a substantial touch and opened into a floor-sweeping train.\n\n**Ethereal Beauty - Zendaya**\n\nRising star Zendaya owned the red carpet giving an ode to Sharon Stone's 1998 Oscar get-up. The Euphoria actor drew glances with her micro Valentino haute couture button-up and silver sequined skirt, designed by her storyteller stylist Law Roach. The look was a masterclass in modern elegance with a nostalgic twist.\n\n**Darkness Reimagined - Billie Eilish**\n\nHaunting, black and unmissable, Billie Eilish dramatized the event with designer Alessandro Michele's off-shoulder black ruffle Gucci gown which came with a floor-sweeping long train. Moreover, she matched her hair with the outfit, styling it into bangs curling outwards. The dramatic silhouette perfectly captured her unique aesthetic.\n\n**Punk Princess - Kristen Stewart**\n\nThe best actor nominee for her role in \"Spencer\" about Princess Diana wore a custom Chanel black satin shorts suit that gave two manicured fingers to every traditional tulle dress at Hollywood's big night. Stewart paired her suit with Chanel Fine Jewelry ganse noir spinel necklace for its unique and sparkly spin on the tie.\n\n**Suave Manliness - Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet**\n\nTimoth\u00e9e's risqu\u00e9 fit proved that fashion and timeless design shouldn't be bound by gender. Chalamet's sequined black suit by Louis Vuitton felt particularly fresh given it was plucked from Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re's spring 2022 womenswear collection. The two-piece was accentuated by Cartier's layered necklaces and white gold rings.\n\n**Spiderman Wonderboy - Andrew Garfield**\n\nThe Spiderman wonderboy and equally talented actor, Andrew Garfield was nominated as best actor for his role in \"Tick, Tick... Boom!\" Opting for Saint Laurent's burgundy velvet blazer, black silky shirt and black gabardine pants, accessorizing the look with an Omega watch, Garfield rocked the night.\n\n**The Showstopper - Jason Momoa**\n\nThe well-adored and hulking Dune actor Jason Momoa walked the red carpet wearing a chic upcycled tuxedo from Savile Row, teamed with a bowtie. He styled his look with statement rings, wayfarer glasses and a blue and yellow pocket square in support of Ukraine. He also styled his hair into a French braid, binding it up with a pink scrunchie.\n\n**Pearly Hues - Nikolaj Coster-Waldau**\n\nThe Game of Thrones actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and executive producer for Best Animated Feature Film nominee \"Flee\" was seen donning a cream-colored tuxedo at the 2022 Academy Awards, bringing sophisticated elegance to the red carpet.\n\nThe 94th Academy Awards proved once again that the red carpet is not just about fashion\u2014it's about making statements, celebrating individuality, and showcasing the artistry that extends beyond the films themselves. Each look told a story, reflecting the personality and creative vision of both the wearer and their styling team.",

    "excerpt": "In today's digital era, the practice of double wristing\u2014wearing both a smartwatch and traditional timepiece\u2014is becoming the new normal among fashion-forward individuals.",
    "body": "In the world where men are embracing gender fluidity and exhibiting crazy clothes, being spotted sporting a watch in both hands might not seem so weird. Double wristing is more than a style and status statement. In today's digital era, when one single smartwatch provides you all the features, you might wonder what's the use of sporting two watches. Well let me help you understand the relevance of double wristing.\n\nThis practice is trending and many icons and celebrities seem to love it. However, it has been observed that many watch sailors were practicing it for decades.\n\n## The Perfect Tech-Art Combination\n\nDrilling this trend may grab people's attention towards you. They might question you for doing the same. But trust me! It will make a lot of sense. Because the smartwatches digital technology will lend you digital access and help you to keep updating yourselves with all latest technology. Traditional watches will give you a perfect vintage look holding up their finest craftsmanship and artisanal creations. This duo of tech-art will make you stand out from the crowd.\n\n## Celebrity Endorsement\n\nIf you are a person who keeps an eye on traditional watches or spends time scrolling through the latest updates of watch-selling companies, double wristing might not be so rare for you. It has already been raised as a highlighted topic. Hodinkee was the first company to publish a story on wearing an Apple watch and vintage watch together in 2019.\n\nDouble-downing horological masterpieces simultaneously were already normalized in the world of celebrities. Chris Pratt, Billie Eilish, and even the late Princess Diana have already been highlighted in the headlines practicing this trend. Actor Bill Murray was also spotted wearing a double-wristing at the Cannes Film Festival 2022.\n\n## The Future of Wearable Tech\n\nOne has to agree with the fact that double wristing has been popular with the advent of smartwatches. Many watch enthusiasts have found a way to combine their luxury timepieces with smartwatches. The digital features of the smartwatches and the spacious artisanship of vintage timepieces are a perfect combo to sport with any outfit.\n\nThe moment when you start practising this method of watch wearing, you will realize that smartwatches and traditional watches both are different devices that gives you different experiences. Not all watches are created similarly. Some are really horological pieces that can show the time, but others are technically forward, having a lot of features.\n\n## Why Settle When You Can Make It Double?\n\nI believe this trend is here to stay. The fact that we are in a time where timeless beauty and craftsmanship can be combined with the latest technology is simply mind-boggling. I can't wait for the time when sporting two watches becomes the new normal. Who knows what will happen next? Honestly, it's all just a game of time.\n\nWe all were born with two wrists for a good reason. Here is the new trend called 'Double Wristing' - combining smartwatch functionality with conventional watch elegance to enhance your personality in any outfit.",

    "excerpt": "Debuting her music career with Fugly, Aastha Gill sure has come a long way. In conversation with Just Urbane, she talks about her childhood, working with Badshah, Khatron ke Khiladi season 11, and much more.",
    "body": "From Dolce and Gabbana's gem studded Spring Summer'22 collection to the 'Buzz' queen of the industry, Aastha Gill has made her mark in Bollywood music. Debuting her music career with Fugly, she sure has come a long way. In this exclusive conversation with Just Urbane, she opens up about her journey, collaborations, and aspirations.\n\n## The Musical Foundation\n\n**What was your childhood like? How were you as a student and did you always aspire to become a singer?**\n\nI grew up in a very happy household sharing a very close bond with my family and especially my sister. I had a normal upbringing just like every other child in Delhi. I was always inclined towards music and dance from a very young age. Being a music director, my dad would practice music in the house and always insisted that I learn music and taught me a lot along the way. \n\nI was always passionate about dancing, singing, and performing. Basically, taking over the stage. I would always participate in school and college fests. Having graduated in mass communication, I was working in an ad agency where I got my first break from a college fest and that's how my journey towards career in music started.\n\n## The Bollywood Debut\n\n**As we all know that your Bollywood singing debut was through Fugly, how would you like to share that experience and the efforts behind it?**\n\nWhen I got my first break for Fugly, I was actually still working with an Ad Agency, and I was super excited to get such a great opportunity. I loved the thrill of recording for the first time for a movie and the whole experience was so new and fresh for me.\n\n## Mentorship and Growth\n\n**How has the music industry been to you to date? Who has been a mentor to you in your journey all these years?**\n\nMy dad would always play music at home and we use to jam together, he taught me a lot about music theory. He has been my first mentor as a kid. Also, I would like to add that Badshah Bhai has been my mentor too and he has always supported me and guided me through.\n\n## Fashion and Style Philosophy\n\n**What's your definition of fashion and how do you prefer making statements just through your style?**\n\nI love making statements through my style and that's how I would define my style. I'm a digger for sneakers, shades, bags, and caps. Recently, I have discovered my love for Indian attires and totally enjoying it this wedding season. As I mentioned, Badshah bhai is a great inspiration for doing this. \n\nI believe everyone has their unique style and one should nurture it and bring forward what suits them most, irrespective of time and age. But honestly, I haven't completely explored this road of fashion but totally looking forward to it in the upcoming years.\n\n## The Badshah Connection\n\n**You've had major hit songs with Badshah and the audience just can't stop grooving to your music. What would you like to tell us about working with Badshah? Are we going to see any more songs in the near future?**\n\nMy experience with Badshah bhai has always been incredibly great. He is family to me and when we work on a project it is more like a family working together. He is a big brother, who has always guided me towards the best and has been very kind to me since the beginning. \n\nIt is such a homely and chill vibe working with him and the space he creates for two artists to collaborate is incredible. Whoever has worked with Badshah would say he is the most easiest to work with. Yes, you'll be hearing a lot more from us.\n\n## Favorite Tracks and Musical Preferences\n\n**It will go unsaid that you love all the songs that you've sung. But we would like to know which one of them holds a special place in your heart and why?**\n\nAs you said, I love them all but I think I enjoy Buzz, Paani Paani, and most recent Saawariya the most.\n\n**What kind of music do you prefer listening to and what inspires you to take on a new project?**\n\nAs a listener, I enjoy a variety of music from Punjabi to Bollywood to Pop to world music, etc. I personally am a party person, so I end up listening to a lot of party songs and singing them as well. But in near future, I'll be trying more genres and exploring new soundscapes with my music.\n\n## Industry Insights and Challenges\n\n**You've been in the Bollywood music industry for quite some time now. How healthy is the competition among singers in the industry?**\n\nHonestly, I don't really think about it in such a way. I believe one gets what they are destined for and we have to just keep working hard each day. Nothing else defines the path of our success besides our hard work and everyone is on their individual journey so it won't be fair to compete.\n\n**I'm sure you've had quite a journey paving your way to where you are today. Was there ever a rough patch on the way and would you like to share how you overcame it?**\n\nThe struggle is always there and everyone faces their share of struggles and I guess that's what really pushes us to overcome them. But today, even after delivering so many hit songs people sometimes don't know you well due to the general image of a singer in Bollywood is that of a playback artist. A lot of people have asked me if I was the model in the Buzz song, but no I have sung that song as well. I think it is getting better now and it will get better in times to come.\n\n## Khatron Ke Khiladi Experience\n\n**You've been in the buzz for your actions in KKK11. Would you say that your journey there has been a bit life changing?**\n\nYes, indeed it has been. When you try something for the first time, the experience is always life-changing and a memorable one. In fact, there were several factors that made me take this project up. When I got a call for KKK, I was a little unsure initially but then I was like bring it on as I have not done any reality show in the past and this will be my debut on television and what better way than to start it with my favourite show, KKK. \n\nI always wanted to be a part of a reality tv show that showcases my inner personality which is not completely possible through a song or a social media post for the audience/fans to see who Aastha Gill really is. Secondly, it was time to face my fears and through this show, I was able to overcome a lot of them.\n\n## Words of Inspiration\n\n**What inspiration would you like to give our readers?**\n\nI would like to tell all the readers to always follow their passion and never leave the path under any pressure or situation. Have trust in the process. And lastly, always love what you do and do what you love.\n\n*\"As a child, I was passionate about dancing, singing, and performing. Basically, taking over the stage. I never gave up on that.\"* - Aastha Gill",
