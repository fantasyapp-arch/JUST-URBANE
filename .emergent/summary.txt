The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on the Just Urbane application, primarily focusing on two key areas: enhancing existing UI components and integrating a new payment gateway. Initially, the engineer tackled pending frontend tasks from previous interactions. The first major task involved redesigning the Perfect Suit Guide for Men article page, following a user request to standardize its appearance with other premium articles (like ). This involved significant refactoring of  to incorporate breadcrumbs, a dedicated hero section, rich content styling, tags, and back navigation, successfully integrating three new images. This was followed by multiple iterations of user-requested modifications to the footer in , specifically concerning copyright text and a hyperlink to Satmat Group. These UI updates were verified with screenshots. The final and ongoing task involved integrating the Razorpay payment gateway. The engineer initiated this by obtaining the Razorpay playbook, analyzing the existing Stripe payment architecture in both backend (, ) and frontend (, ), installing necessary dependencies, and implementing backend endpoints and frontend UI elements for Razorpay. The process concluded with a request for the Razorpay Key Secret from the user, indicating the integration is partially complete and pending credential provision for testing.

The Just Urbane application serves as a luxury digital magazine platform. The development trajectory focused on enhancing content presentation, refining branding elements, and expanding payment options.

**Completed tasks within this trajectory:**
*   **Men's Fashion Article Page Enhancement:** The Perfect Suit Guide for Men: Corporate Dressing Excellence article page () was refactored to align with the premium aesthetic and structure of existing articles (e.g., ). This included adding breadcrumbs, a distinct hero image section, detailed article metadata, rich content styling with integrated images, a tags section, and back navigation. Three new images were incorporated.
*   **Footer Branding Updates:** The application's footer () was updated iteratively. Initially, Designed and Developed by satmat group was added. This was then refined to © 2025 Just Urbane. Designed and Developed by Satmat Group with Satmat Group hyperlinked to . Finally, the text was updated to © 2025 Just Urbane. All rights reserved. Designed and Developed by Satmat Group.

**Current task in progress:**
*   **Razorpay Payment Gateway Integration:** The user requested the integration of Razorpay for magazine purchases, connecting it with existing buying and subscription systems. This involves integrating Razorpay alongside the currently implemented Stripe gateway.

2.  **Backend Integration ():**
    *   New FastAPI endpoints ( and ) were added to handle the creation of Razorpay orders and the verification of payments.
    *   New Pydantic models for Razorpay order and payment details were created to manage data integrity.
    *   The  file was updated to include .
3.  **Frontend Integration ( and ):**
    *   The  utility file was updated with functions to interact with the new Razorpay backend endpoints.
    *   The  component was significantly modified to:
        *   Load the Razorpay SDK script dynamically.
        *   Adjust the  data structure to include appropriate  values for both Stripe and Razorpay.
        *   Refactor the subscription button section to present distinct options for Pay with Stripe and Pay with Razorpay, allowing users to choose their preferred payment method.

The current state is that the Razorpay integration is partially complete. The necessary code structures are in place, but the integration cannot be fully tested or deployed without the . The AI engineer is awaiting this crucial credential and confirmation on testing with live or test keys from the user.
